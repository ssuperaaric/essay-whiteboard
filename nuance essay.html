By using interactive artefacts with physically simulated dynamic behaviors, it benefits nuanced control as it calls back to real life instances that everyone has experienced, inheriting the familiar bodily skill we already have, thus prompt the state of nuanced control to come earlier.

In the final sketch our team designed, our artifact basically simulates a real-life curling scenario. The sound comes from the action of scratching the surface, which simulates the action of using a brush to rub the ice surface in front of the curling ball in actual curling, which makes it melt into water, thereby reducing friction, decreases the deceleration of the curling ball.
This satisfies the basic laws of friction and uniform deceleration linear motion in physical dynamics.

In another experiment, we thought that since the output was already in the form of a screen, thus we don't need to follow the real-life curling scenario, and we sought to break the constraints of real-world physics. So we made a sketch, in which the curling not only has speed on the x-axis, that is, the motion trajectory is a straight line, but also has speed on the y-axis. This realizes that the motion trajectory of curling ball during natural sliding can turn halfway, and the angle of this turn can be controlled by the scratching sound we send as input. This obviously does not satisfy the laws of physics, because the scraping action only changes the friction force, and does not apply a lateral force to the object, which should keep moving in a straight line.

Both of the above cases enable nuanced control because they both allow direct manuability, in the words of Heyer, C. (2018), “Expression of direct manipulability is in the tight coupling of action and response.” (p. 496) In the above two artefacts, the artefact can make continuous feedback to the user's continuous scratching sound input, and the nuances of the scratching sound can be expressed in real time through the speed or speed&turning angle as feedback. This also meets the requirements of nuanced control for the manipulability of objects, that is, when a design openly allows the user to perform nuanced movements to control it, and can give corresponding feedback to the nuanced movements through its own nuanced changes, it is considered to have high manipulability.(Heyer, C. 2018)

Although nuanced control can be achieved in the above two cases, the time point when nuanced control is achieved is different in the two cases.

We felt the difference in the degree of difficulty of these two direct manipulability in the process of actual interaction, that is, earlier (easy) or later (difficult) to achieve nuanced control. When controlling that sketch with a behavior that satisfies the physics dynamics, we can perform the bodily skill of scraping relatively proficiently after 8 or 10 games to have nuanced control over the straight-line speed of the curling ball. For example, nuanced increasing the force as the curling slows down, to melt the imaginary "ice" on the screen. This is in line with our previous habits in real life, and it is easy to achieve earlier. In contrast, in the process of operating a sketch that does not conform to physical dynamics, it takes around 50 games to master the scraping to control its turning angle. Because although coping with it is direct manipulability, the process is tortuous - we have not experienced the experience of controlling the turning of objects by scratching, so we feel that this feedback is abnormal, as novices, skilled and nuanced control is not easy, thus later, to achieve.

The above phenomenon can be explained by Fogtmann's theory, he regards this as "Expressive meaning", in the process of interaction, when the user's body movements are consistent with the feedback of the design, this "Expressive meaning" is generated. “The interactive possibilities are congruent with the kinesthetic capabilities the design has been made for – and the bodily interaction is meaningful for achieving the system goal.”
 (Fogtmann, M. H., Fritsch, J., & Kortbek, K. J, 2008, p. 93). One example in Fogtmann, M. H., et al's (2008) paper is a game of whack-a-mole called “Octopus Trainer” (p94). Because the actions that occur when playing this virtual game are a complete simulation of team handball in the real world, therefore, it provides expressive meaning. In the above sketch that satisfies physical dynamics, the dynamics of interaction is "mapping of the interaction in the physical world" (Fogtmann, M. H., et al, p. 94), so it has expressive meaning. However, in sketches that do not satisfy physical dynamics, the feedback behavior of the ball and the human input action are not logical, or the user needs to impose a certain meaning on it, so it lacks expressive meaning.

From another perspective, we can also use Dreyfus, H’s (2002) affordance theory to explain the above phenomenon, that is, "The agent sees things from some perspective and sees them as affording certain actions. What the affordances are depends on past experience with that sort of thing in that sort of situation” (Dreyfus, H, 2002, p. 373). In the above sketches that satisfy physical dynamics, because we have experienced curling or a similar experience with curling, this helps to recognize affordance of the artifact. But in sketches that do not satisfy physical dynamics, Its weird behavior doesn't fit our "appropriate memories of other aspects of that object with the current experience"(Dreyfus, H, 2002, p. 373), so it lacks affordance.

According to Dreyfus, H (2002), the process of achieving proficiency is the transformation of the manipulator's skills from a state of rigid response guided by theory to a state of being able to recognize subtle changes and react according to them. By adding expressive meaning and affordance, artifact with physically simulated dynamic behavior is friendly for skill building, that is, there is no need to learn this bodily skill from scratch, so that intuitive behavior replaces reasoned responses earlier, and users enter the state of skillful and nuanced control earlier, which is helpful for nuanced control.





Artifacts with physically simulated dynamic behavior benefit nuanced control

Introduction
For the output of interactive artifacts, it can contain various types of behaviors, such as the anthropomorphic behavior mentioned by Djajadiningrat, T., Matthews, B., & Stienstra, M. (2007), where “the appearance and movements are dominated by human or animal like bodily configurations and faces” (p.669). In this article, the focus is on the physically simulated dynamic behavior of the artifact, 
It means that the artifact not only has dynamic properties, but its dynamics also obey the laws of physics, which can also be regarded as a simulation of the behavior of objects in the real world.

至于nuance control，按照xxx的话说，
We manage change, uncertainty and contingency by continually making nuanced corrections according to what is becoming around us.


In this article, based on the experimental process of the "curling game" project, I argued my view: "Physically simulated autonomous behavior of the artefacts encourages gross motor skills based nuance control”. Because by incorporating physically simulated autonomous behavior into artifacts, It provides effective feedforward to guide gross motor skills based nuance control, increase user interest in gross motor skills based nuance control, provide expressive feedback to respond hence encourage gross motor skills based nuance control.

meaningful driect manuability
By using interactive artefacts with physically simulated dynamic behaviors,它有助于细微控制，因为它调动现实生活中的人人都经历过的实例，继承了我们已经具有的熟悉的bodily skill，所以促进nuance control的状态更早到来。

在我们的小组设计最终的sketch中，我们的工件基本重现，模拟了现实生活中的冰壶运动的情景。其中声音的发出是源于我们刮擦物体表面的动作，这模拟了实际冰壶运动中的利用刷子来摩擦冰壶前面的冰面的动作，这使其融化成水，进而减小摩擦力，使冰壶的减速度减小。这满足物理动态学中的基本摩擦力及匀减速直线运动定律。其中另一个实验是，我们觉得既然输出已经是以屏幕的形式了，我们也就可以不遵守现实生活中的冰壶情景了，我们便寻求打破现实世界里的物理条件的限制。于是我们制作了一个sketch，其中冰壶只不光在x轴上有速度，即运动轨迹是直线，而且还在y轴上有速度，这就实现了冰壶在自然滑行时的运动轨迹可以半途拐弯，而这个转弯的角度是可以由我们发出的作为输入的刮擦的声音来控制的。这显然不满足物理定律，因为刮擦动作只会改变摩擦力，并不会给物体施加侧方向的力，物体本应保持直线运动。

以上两种情况都实现了细微差别控制，因为他们都允许了direct manuability，以xxx的话说, “Expression of direct manipulability is in the tight coupling of action and response.”
在以上两个工件中，工件对用户持续的刮擦声音的输入可以做出持续的反馈，对刮擦声音的细微差别可以实时的同样细微的通过速或速度加转弯角度表达出来以作为输出反馈。这同时符合nuanced control对物件manipulability的要求，即An artifact with high manipulability reveals and allows for nuanced action and enables us to maintain a nuanced impression of its state and the result of action.
当一个设计品开放地允许细微动作对它的操控，并可以通过它本身的细微的变化来对细微动作进行反馈时，它就被认为是具有高度manipulability。
而且还有mapping 

虽然以上两种情况都实现了细微差别控制，但两种情况中nuanced control的达成时间点却是不同的。

我们在实验的实际交互控制的过程中感觉到了这两种direct manipulability的难易程度的不同，即更早（易）或更晚（难）实现nuanced control。在控制那个具有满足物理动态学的行为的sketch的时候，我们在经历四到五场游戏后就可以相对熟练地perform the bodily skill of 刮擦来对冰壶的直线速度进行细微差别控制。比如，当冰壶减速时细微差别地加大力度，来使想象中的屏幕上的“冰”融化。这符合我们以往实际生活中的习惯，更早实现得心应手。相比之下，在操作那个不符合物理动态学的行为的sketch的过程中，经过20到30场游戏后才可以刮擦来控制其转弯。因为与它coping尽管是direct manipulability，但是过程却是曲折的—我们并没有经历过刮擦而控制物体转弯的经历，所以觉得这种反馈是异常的, nuanced control不容易（更晚）实现。


以上现象可以由Fogtmann的理论解释，他 regard this as “Expressive meaning”，在交互过程中，当用户身体的动作与设计品的反馈具有一致性时，这种“Expressive meaning”便产生了。“The interactive possibilities are congruent with the kinesthetic capabilities the design has been made for – and the bodily interaction is meaningful for achieving the system goal.”
One example in Fogtmann, M. H., et al’s (2008) paper is a game of whack-a-mole, they call it “Octopus Trainer”(p94). Because the actions that occur when playing this virtual game are a complete simulation of team handball in the real world, therefore, it provides expressive meaning。在以上满足物理动态学的sketch中，交互的动态是“mapping of the interaction in the physical world”, 所以具有Expressive meaning。但在不满足物理动态学的sketch中，球的反馈行为与人的输入动作之间并无一致性，所以缺乏Expressive meaning。




Expressive meaning occurs when the bodily engagement fits the
system output. The interactive possibilities are congruent with the
kinesthetic capabilities the design has been made for – and the
bodily interaction is meaningful for achieving the system goal.

The movements provoked by the equipment are the same as the ones executed when playing the actual sport, in this case team handball, which gives expressive meaning to the kinesthetic development.

The expressive meaning is clear in the mapping of the interaction in
the physical world, and the resulting gameplay in the virtual
world. p94

Expressive meaning occurs because there is congruence between what the person with the remote control is doing,

xxx regard this as experience

. The agent sees things from some perspective and sees them as affording certain actions. What the affordances are depends on past experience with that sort of thing in that sort of situation.

So one would have had to already have recognized an impression as an as-pect of an object in order to associate the appropriate memories of other aspects of that object with the current experience.*

从另一个角度，我们还可以用xxx的理论来解释以上现象，即“The agent sees things from some perspective and sees them as affording certain actions. What the affordances are depends on past experience with that sort of thing in that sort of situation.” 在以上满足物理动态学的sketch中，因为我们经历过冰壶或相似与冰壶的经历，这有助于recognize affordance of the artifact. 但在不满足物理动态学的sketch中，它的怪异行为不符合我们的“appropriate memories of other aspects of that object with the current experience”，所以其缺乏affordance。



As Djajadiningrat, T., et al (2007) said, this provides a huge contribution to the creation of a continuous perception-action loop.


The performer’s theory of the skill, as represented by rules and principles, will thus gradually be replaced by situational discriminations accompanied by associated responses. Proficiency seems to develop if, and only if, experience is assimilated in this atheoretical way and intuitive behavior replaces reasoned responses.

according to xxx, 实现熟练操作的过程，即是操控者的skill由理论指导作出僵硬反应的状态到可以识别细微变化并根据他们做出反应状态的转型。
通过增加Expressive meaning和affordance，physically simulated dynamic behavior对新手友好，不需要从零开始学习这种bodily skill，intuitive behavior 更早 replaces reasoned responses，更早进入skillful and nuance control的状态，有助于细微控制。




按照clint所说，when we act and feel through an artifact rendered transparent.虽然在后者中，经过反复训练，我们也可以将冰壶的转弯角度与刮擦动作相挂钩，即实现direct manipulability。但相比前者，这对新手是不友好的，因为前者中的现实生活中的玩球我们已具备这种动觉技巧，引drey，所以对细微变化更加敏感，更早进入skillful and nuance control的状态。但后者中，一开始我们则不会根据角度的细微差别来判别动作的输入程度，需要从零开始学习这种bodily skill。更早进入skillful and nuance control的状态也就是更早使feel through an artifact rendered transparent，即benefit direct manipulability, 从而benefit nuance.

在以上提到的最终的sketch中，因为其模拟了现实生活中的冰壶球运动的情景，即，从球从屏幕左侧弹出至其停止的一刻为止，屏幕上呈现出来的，是一个不间断的减速度不断变化的减速直线运动的过程。这满足物理动态学定律。我们的小组项目中还有另一个试验，即，在屏幕上模拟一个被竖直上抛的球，它的y轴坐标与声音频率挂钩，即频率越大它的高度越高。但实际操控时，由于直接y轴坐标与声音频率的直接挂钩导致了球的位置变化过快，我们便利用了几个if及elseif语句来给频率分成不同档。这样虽然做到了对声音频率的过滤，但最终屏幕上呈现出来的球的行为方式，是其位置在不同档间跳跃，或者说瞬移。这是一个失败的物理模拟，其显然不符合物理定律，因为现实世界中球的运动是连贯的而不是瞬变的。

在与那个不符合物理定律的草图交互时，我们最终也无法实现细微差别控制。例如，当我们在发出声音的时候，即使我们之前在操纵其他可细微差别控制的sketch时，在发声方面已经积累了技巧，也就是有了使用不同力度或换成不同表面来摩擦而发出具有细微差别的声音的能力。但这个设计品的输出仍然只在几个固定的高度，即档位，之间变化。所以某个范围内，即使我们稍微改变声音频率，这些改变也总是被囊括进某一个档中，球便始终停留在某一高度。我们感觉到了用户日益细腻的发声技巧所已经作用在物件上而产生的更加敏感的影响与物件僵硬固定的反馈之间的矛盾。而这种单一的反馈也让我们不知道刚刚发出的声音是稍微大了或是稍微小了，从而无法锻炼出可适用与这个设计品的，即发声而控制球的高度的，细腻的技巧。而在符合物理动态学的最终草图中，我们所锻炼出来的刮擦力度速度等细腻技巧，都可以在设计品的实时变化的速度中体现出来，例如当球的减速度稍微快了一点时，我们便也稍微加大刮擦力度以求接下来更小的摩擦力。

以上现象的出现，



This nuance is often
lacking in interaction design, perhaps in part because of the
dominance of using symbolic approaches to express meaning,
such as icons, text and colour.


The text feedback ‘storage
space is running low’ does not permit a nuanced reading.
Nuance can be expressed when these techniques are com-bined, for example, in a file listing colouring the file name to
express if it is encrypted and overlaying a symbol if the file
has been synchronized, or perhaps more promisingly, utilizing
non-symbolic or non-visual means altogether. Examples tech-niques might be shaping-changing artifacts (Rasmussen et al.,
2012) or haptic sensations (Moussette and Banks, 2011).
